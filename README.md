Force Plate Project

Overview

The Force Plate Project is designed to analyze athlete performance by processing force plate readings. This project primarily focuses on baseball, softball, and basketball teams, with plans to expand to other sports. By leveraging data analytics, the project helps strength coaches make data-driven training decisions.

Features

Data Collection: Weekly force plate readings capturing 11 key performance metrics.

Processing & Analysis: Data is cleaned, processed, and analyzed for performance insights.

Visualization: R Shiny applications generate interactive dashboards and customizable graphs.

Decision Support: Strength coaches can use real-time insights to optimize training programs.
